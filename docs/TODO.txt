Todo for Milestone 3
======================
[✓] Add Any Ptr
[✓] Add Null
[✓] initialize upon declaration
    Dim i As Integer = 10
[✓] add Var that deducts the type from right hand expression
    Var i = 10
[✓] Add For
    For i = 0 to 10 [ step Expression ]
        StmtList
    Next
[✓] make parenthesis optional for FuncStmt
    printf "hello %s\n", "world"
[ ] Overhaul the type system
[✓] Support building for 32bit and 64bit
[✓] Move internal type conversion to llvm into Type class
[✓] Add easy way to add test cases to check compiler output
[✓] Add subs
[✓] Add generic command line options
    [✓] --help      Display available options
    [✓] --version   Show version information
    [✓] -v          Show verbose output
    [✓] -o <file>   Write output to <file>
    [✓] -O<number>  Set optimization level to <number>
    [✓] -m32        Generate 32bit i386 code
    [✓] -m64        Generate 64bit x86-64 code
    [✓] -S          Only compile. Emit assembly files
    [✓] -c          Compile and assemble. Emit object files
    [✓] -llvm       Emit llvm files


Todo for Milestone 4
======================
[ ] Adopt a coding standard for c++ source
    - http://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html
      o This is really nice one. Especially since already using llvm. Few minor
        annoyances with this one is that it likes to CamelCase variables with
        capital first letter...
[ ] create bootstrap and make scripts for compiling lbc on other
    systems and compilers. Or use some alternative build system? scons ?
[ ] Add calling convention info to FunctionType
[ ] add name mangling to Type
[ ] Implement proper error messages (lex, parse, sem. linking)
[ ] Function pointers
[ ] assignment expressions outside function bodies
[ ] Implement EXIT (for) keyword
[ ] Implement CONTINUE (for) keyword
[ ] Implement DO ... LOOP construct
[ ] Improve FOR
    [ ] Support negative STEP (decrement)
    [ ] Optimize for simple cases


Future. M5 ?
==============
[ ] Implement Expression parser
    [ ] Addition
    [ ] Subtraction
    [ ] Multiplication
    [ ] Division
    [ ] Modulus
    [ ] Logical And
    [ ] Logical Or
    [ ] Not
    [ ] Xor
    [ ] POW ^
    [ ] Bitwise And &
    [ ] Bitwise Or |
    [ ] Comparisons
[ ] Add char type
    Need to think about this and figure it out how it should work,
    what's its underlying datatype, character encoding, etc... 
    Have a look at Go
    [ ] string literals should be of type Char Ptr
    [ ] allow character literals in tildes
        Dim a As Char = `A` ' 65
    [ ] allow assigning integer literals to Char type
    [ ] allow assigning array of integer values to Char array
        Dim hello As Char[] = [72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 0]
[ ] add pointer indexing. 0 based
    Dim argv As Byte Ptr Ptr
    Dim arg As Byte Ptr
    arg = argv[1]


===============================================================================

Todo for Milestone 2
======================

                StmtList
                ( "ELSE" ( ifStmt | StmtList "END" "IF" )
                | "END" "IF"
                )
[✓] add BooleanExpression
    * only "=" and "<>"
