Re-implement Context
======================
- store include paths, library paths, files
- do not check if library exists. ld will do that
- use llvm/path
- use triple for generating output
  * make this optional. if files are compiled to ll files
    then no need to do any platform checking
- get default platform triple.

Driver
-------
driver the compilation process
- allow simply linking
- compiling individual files
- linking with .o files
- emitting llvm
- emit .o, .s, executable (platform dependent)

Emitter
--------
- Use context for checking platform specifics
